# Emoji Tree

This is a proof-of-concept for a Research Project I am currently working on. The purpose of Emoji Tree is to provide a fast, reliable and easy way for users to enter emoji inputs on their browsers. The plan is to use effective HCI techniques and also personalized input to give users exactly the emoji they are looking for with ease. I have plans on making a chrome extension once I am satisfied with the POC. Please see the `extension` branch (if there is one) to find out more.
